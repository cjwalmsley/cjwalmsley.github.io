  I am a PhD student focusing on cognitive language models for robotics augmentation. I also work as a Software Delivery Manager at an investment bank. My research interests include cognitive architectures, natural language processing, multi-modal porcessing and human-robot interaction. I am proficient in Python and Smalltalk and enjoy applying theoretical concepts to practical problems.
